# Brainfuck
A repository to play with different brainfuck implementations

## Motivation 
I am currently working on a jit compiler generator as my bachelor thesis so I
wanted to actually implement some jit compiler to get a feeling for it and 
brainfuck is a small enough language that suits itself to it.

## Progress
At the moment I am working on a simple interpreter but after that I will try to 
implement a jit with llvm.
